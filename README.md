Tarot Card Reading:
Prompt the participant to focus on a question or intention.
Use an API that provides tarot card information, such as the Tarot API (https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api).
Randomly select a set of tarot cards based on the participant's input or a random selection.
Display the selected tarot cards along with their meanings and interpretations retrieved from the API.
Provide a personalized reading based on the combination of the selected cards.
